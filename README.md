Largely, personal experiments with information retrieval (IR) and language models:
1. Built a RAG-based IR for arxiv to retrive and answer questions pertinent to recent papers/research. This is based on some techniques taught in Stanford course `Creating Production Ready Language Models` 
2. (WIP) - Generative agents
